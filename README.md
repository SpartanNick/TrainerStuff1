# TrainerStuff1

## Intended public
For my valued students &amp; otherwise general curious public.

## Disclaimer
This is offered with no warranty. I don't pretend the code is perfect (or even near perfect), quite the contrary, this is mostly "quick & dirty" stuff, really.

But the goal is that it should be good enough for demo & learning purposes.

## What you will find
Some libraries in R, mostly, for demo of specific stuff, be it data visualization, anomaly detection, etc.

## Helpful: The Lab
You might want to set up a lab to test out the code here.

I prep'd a quick & dirty Docker container for just this purpose, that you can build from a Dockerfile. I will be posting the details on that right here in this section.

### Pre-requisites
As a pre-requisite though, you'll need to be able to "docker build" stuff. I suggest to use "docker desktop" for non-Linux users, and here are a few references, depending on your OS:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/

For Linux users, a relevant documentation pointer would be: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/


### Setting up the lab
Pending documentation.
