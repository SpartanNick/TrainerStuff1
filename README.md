# TrainerStuff1

## Intended public
For my valued students &amp; otherwise general curious public.

## Disclaimer
This is offered with no warranty. I don't pretend the code is perfect (or even near perfect), quite the contrary, this is mostly "quick & dirty" stuff, really.

But the goal is that it should be good enough for demo & learning purposes.

## What you will find
Some libraries in R, mostly, for demo of specific stuff, be it data visualization, anomaly detection, etc.

## Helpful: The Lab
You might want to set up a lab to test out the code here.

You can skip this section altogether if you have a working R + RStudio + Shiny environment. Make sure though that you check for the required libraries before you go into the code snippets, as those required libraries (in some instances) are assumed to be available (and some have OS-level packages dependencies...).

I prepared a quick & dirty Docker container for just this purpose, that you can build from a Dockerfile.

I will be posting the details on that right here in this section.

Once again, there are some tweaks that I didn't implement (so expect some warnings and other such messages while building stuff) as this is just for demo purposes.

### Pre-requisites
As a pre-requisite though, you'll need to be able to "docker build" stuff. I suggest to use "docker desktop" for non-Linux users, and here are a few references, depending on your OS:

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/

https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/

For Linux users, a relevant documentation pointer would be: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

On top of whatever requirements for compatibility with the Docker flavor of choice, you'll need about 0,5GB of spare RAM memory, and about 3GB of HD (2 for the container itself, and a bit more for code and sample data). Obviously, the more you manage to have of both, the better for the Lab setup...

### Setting up the lab
Pending documentation.
